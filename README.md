Example ASP.NET Web Site Project
================================

This is an ASP.NET Web Site Project created from the "ASP.NET Web Forms Site"
project template (under Visual C# -> Web -> Previous Versions) in VS2017
15.9.38 with the name "MyWebSiteProject" and .NET Framework 4.6.1 (the
default).

Note that this project does not have a `.csproj` file, which is one of the
[differences between Web Application Projects and Web Site Projects in Visual
Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/aspnet/dd547590(v=vs.110)).
